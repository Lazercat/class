# Attendance

## Policy

- 3 late arrivals = 1 absence. 5 minutes late results in a tardy.
- Missing part of the day of class counts as Â½ day absence
- Students can have no more than 3 absences
- If you are unable to avoid being late or need to request an absence: Let your instructors know via the private slack channel set up for you.

You will take your own attendance through Garnet while on the `WeWork` or `WWGuest` wifi network. Please check [the graduation requirements for arriving on-time](graduation-requirements.md)!

If class begins at 9:00AM, then any attendance taken at 9:01 will be considered "tardy". Attendance cannot be taken three hours after the start time. That is: if you try to take attendance at 12:01, you will be considered "absent".
